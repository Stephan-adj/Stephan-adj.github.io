# Numpy arrays

We are going to deal with numpy arrays along this practice session.
Prior to implementing any formulas using Numpy, let's be more knowledgeable with this data structure.

Importing needed librairies:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## A scalar

A real number, an element of a fied. Enables to define vector space.

```python
scalar = 4.2 # a real number
```

## A vector

### Creation

We are going to use the *array* constructor to create such vector.<br>
The numpy `ndim` attribute gives the number of dimensions.<br>
The numpy `shape` attribute gives the number of elements in each dimensions, hence returning a *tuple*.<br>
The numpy `size` attribute gives the number of elements in the array. You could also do the product between each number of elements in each dimension to get the same value: `np.prod(array.shape)`.<br>

```python
vector_1D = np.array([4])
vector_1D_of_multiple_elements = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6])

print(vector_1D, vector_1D_of_multiple_elements)
print(vector_1D.shape, vector_1D_of_multiple_elements.shape)
print(vector_1D.ndim, vector_1D_of_multiple_elements.ndim)

print(vector_1D.size, vector_1D_of_multiple_elements.size)
```



```python
matrix = np.array([
            [ 1, 2, 3],
            [ 4, 5, 6]
          ])
```
### Calculus

The impossible sum **1+1**.<br>

```python
a=1+1
print(a)
```

    (array([[1, 4],
            [2, 5],
            [3, 6]]),
     (3, 2),
     2,
     6)
